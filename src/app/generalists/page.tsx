    the world is changing faster than we can imagine. we're stepping into a second renaissance —a digital renaissance—where the shift is as profound as moving from books to media, mechanics to robotics, and even from earth to mars.  
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg md:text-xl mt-4">
    this era is exciting, full of possibilities, and offers opportunities to make a difference in ways we never thought possible. but with all this change comes a big question:  
    how can i adapt to these times? how can i have an impact on the world?
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg md:text-xl mt-4">
    the answer lies in understanding what the renaissance truly means. there are synonyms for it—like generalist, polymath, & scholar.  
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg md:text-xl mt-4">
    but what exactly is a generalist?  
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg md:text-xl mt-4">
    a generalist is someone with a broad range of knowledge and skills but also deep expertise in multiple areas. they embrace diverse experiences, think divergently, and solve problems in creative ways.  
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg md:text-xl mt-4">
    now, i wonder—what traits or habits do these generalists have to succeed in today's digital age?

                i'm a big big believer in the flow state (thanks to watching blue lock anime), where you get so immersed in something that hours fly by without you noticing. i often get into this state when coding, learning something new, or playing chess.

                <p className="text-lg md:text-xl mt-4">
                    for example, media and apps can be created on a computer and shared online.

                <p className="text-lg md:text-xl mt-4">
                    no, it's not coding (although coding is powerful). it's writing.

                <p className="text-lg md:text-xl mt-4">
                    writing helps you think clearly. if you keep everything in your head, you might miss logical connections. it's that moment when you think you understand something, but when someone asks you about it, you can't explain it clearly.
