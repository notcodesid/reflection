                    i don&apos;t know where to start the journal. actually, not even the journal but lately, i&apos;ve developed this love for writing. maybe because i&apos;ve seen a lot of people just write their thoughts. could be on the internet or in a personal note. but one thing i noticed is they really write a lot.

                    so starting with this, right now, i don&apos;t have anything to say. the electricity is cut, i&apos;ve got no internet connection, no games on my mac, and i&apos;m not interested in reading books either. the one i&apos;ve been reading is a bit complicated. needs the internet to understand what the author is actually trying to say.

                    while writing this, there&apos;s this little sound in my head saying just write about your life.
                    recently, i&apos;ve been meeting a lot of people who talk about their careers and what they want to do.

                    i met this random girl not long ago. super energetic, full of enthusiasm. when i talked to her, oh my god, the energy she had. always ready to try something
                    and that made me question myself, what am i going to do in the next 5 years?

                    this same question has come up in many interviews too. &quot;where do you see yourself in 5 years?&quot; and every time, i go speechless. not because i don&apos;t know how to say it, but because i genuinely don&apos;t know what i&apos;m going to do in the next 5 years.

                    i studied science in school, biology student. had a deep interest in human anatomy, metabolism, nutrition, and physiology. i even tried preparing for medical exams for a year. then i realised, it takes a lot of energy to memorize everything. those chemical structures, botany stuff, and i&apos;ve never been good at physics or math.
                    so i dropped the medical idea and joined a random college in my city, doing B.Sc. with botany as my main subject. oh man.

                    after 12th, i really wanted to make money. during covid, i started exploring how to earn as a student. that&apos;s when i found out about software engineering. it sounded cool. i explored a bit, got a basic second-hand laptop, and started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from codewithharry.
