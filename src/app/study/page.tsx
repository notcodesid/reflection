                    we all have hobbies like reading novels, gaming, or binge-watching shows. keep the ones you truly enjoy, but cut out the half-hearted ones. you don't need to sacrifice all your hobbies, just the ones you're not very interested in.

                    time is your most limited resource. if you want to learn something new, invest in good courses or cohorts where resources are structured. or, if you have household chores, pay someone else to do them.

                <p className="text-base">
                    avoid multitasking, but pair low-brain tasks with learning. for example, listen to lectures while walking, then practice what you've learned afterward.

                    high energy lets you pursue your interests fully. exercise is a great way to boost your brain. movement signals to the brain that something important is happening. if exercise were a drug, it would be the most powerful one ever created.

                    working in one place all day is boring. try working from a park, cafe, or balcony. new surroundings act like a "reset button" for your focus.
